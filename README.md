# Homework6-GiphyAPI

This homework was designed to be an exercise in utilizing APIs.

I put together a web page that has a pre-set of terms, creates a button for each, and then when the button is clicked, pulls the term from Giphy's API, dispaying corresponding gifs from their database.

I decided to do a theme of television shows, and included some pre-sets of my favorites.

You can also in this project add additional buttons, and display some gifs from your favorite shows! Horray!
